## Project 1: Applied Data Analysis and Visualization of Offences in the UK for 2014 and 2015 :Project Brief
## Project 1: Applied Data Analysis and Visualization of Offences in the UK for 2014 and 2015

* Downloaded, refined and integrated datasets from a twenty-four month period of Crown Prosecution Service Case Outcomes by Principal Offence Category from the data.gov.uk website (link: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/89d0aef9-e2f9-4d1a-b779-5a33707c5f2c/crown-prosecution-service-case-outcomes-by-principal-offence-category-data).

* With the use of Python, data analytics tools and techniques related to descriptive and predictive analytics were applied on the integrated dataset, a prediction model using one linear regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique were developed.
* Prepared a report containing: i.Definition of, at least, two different hypothesis based on the above dataset; ii. Explained and justified cleaning / integration techniques used in the dataset; iii. Analysed and interpretated results using descriptive analytics; iv.Implemented a prediction model using one linear regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique; v. Critically reviewed the data analytics tools and techniques used. Analysed the effectiveness of the techniques used, discussed alternative solutions and compared strengths and weaknesses between them; vi. Critically reviewed the visualisation tools used, analysed the effectiveness of the visualisation tools used, discussed alternative solutions and compared strengths and weaknesses between them.
## Project 2: Business Case Study
## Techniques/Methods for Analysing Data for Landscape Design Application
* Chose four data analysis techniques (Requirement Analyses, Data Collection, Data Cleaning and Data Modelling), analysed and evaluated them.
* Discussed the theoretical aspect of these techniques and the tools that can be used
* Critically analysed and evaluated the applications of these techniques
* Reviewed the available commercial and open-source data analysis software appropriate for the business 
* Selected a business case with the data analysis requirements, synthesised a plan for addressing the probelms with the suggestions of the technique and the available software.
